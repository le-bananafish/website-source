**This a public service announcement from the administrator:**

You can probably tell from the lack of posts that I didn't write any posts last year.<sup>1</sup>

Don't worry, there <u>will be</u> posts this year.

In fact, I'm working on a few posts right now, including _2023 in Review_ which I meant to post in December, or in January, but now that I'm reading over it again, it's written pretty poorly.

I also want to talk about my outlook and aspirations for this year but I won't put a deadline on this.

I'll dare to say that I may even write a story or two this year and there will surely be a post on keyboards as well.<sup>2</sup>

This is all to say an assurance that I have <u>not given up</u> on this site.

As always, and with earnest sincerity, thank you for reading!

\>> <em>Oh, and fortuitous lunisolar cycle renewal!<sup>3</sup></em>

Notes

- <sup>1</sup>: I actually started many posts but kept running out of steam and motivation due to other commitments (the main excuse being postgrad).
- <sup>2</sup>: to elaborate &mdash; *Social Justice* is a good story but needs a rewrite; there's a story I really want to write; and this site is in desperate need of some work.
- <sup>3</sup>: Happy Lunar New Year!
