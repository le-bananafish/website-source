\[Addendum: This post is obviously late in so many ways, you can say it's late<sup><em>3</em></sup> (that's to mean cubed).]

I set myself the lofty goal to "write" and work on my creative projects more this year and you can see from the dearth of posts (this is only my second post of the year<sup>4</sup>) that I have not succeeded. In my defence, I chose to do a postgraduate degree (honours). I was not mentally prepared for that endeavour.

Having finished four and a half years of study in semester 1 last year, I took (worked) the second half of the year off and my brain fell out of the academic zone. And boy did I not expect how hard it was going to be to get back into it. I expected postgrad to be difficult and to have different expectations but what I was caught out by was how different the expectations were.

<!-- What struck me as hard was not just the difficulty of postgrad, which I expected to some extent, but how different the expectations and requirements of an undergrad and postgrad were. -->

The arts honours programme consisted of taking six courses as well as completing a research project over the whole year. I expected to read papers, I expected to have to direct what I was doing myself, but I didn't expect how much I had to direct myself &mdash; I kinda had free rein. I knew and was glad I could and had to choose my own topics (with approval) but it confounded me, annoyed me, 

Part of my honours was a research project spanning the whole year which required me to read a bunch of papers. I expected to read papers but I didn't expect how much I had to guide my own exploration &mdash; sincere gratitude to my supervisor who pushed me to see things I couldn't see. For most of my assignments (read: essays) I got to choose my own topic but I didn't expect that we weren't given a particular direction to take our topics into.

One critical lesson that my supervisor tried to hammer into us and which I didn't truly internalise until I had to truly put my head down and get to work is that _we really don't know how to write sometime or how it's going to turn out until we start_.

<!-- As they say, no matter how much you plan and account for, things are going to change and boy did they change. -->

<!-- My original topic for the research project was going to be a comparison between the 's' sounds in Taiwanese Mandarin and Mainland Mandarin. Mandarin has three 's' sounds, the one in English _set_ /s/, one palatal /ɕ/, and one retroflex /ʂ/. In Taiwan, possibly due to influence from Hokkien (Taiwanese), the distinction between /s/ and /ʂ/ is generally perceived to be weak or lost. I wanted to see if it was truly correct. The research showed that generally yes Taiwanese people did not pronounce a strong distinction between the two sounds but that we did still tell the difference between them. My question was answered and the resulting essay was around two thousand words. I could've seen if this pattern was matched in other variants of Mandarin or in other Chinese "dialects" (Shanghainese, Sichuan, Cantonese, et al.) but it didn't feel like a big enough topic for my research project (10,000 words) so I had to pivot. -->

<!-- My actual topic was on a pattern in a Native American language spoken in Oklahoma known as Kiowa. And it was big enough. It had a process that seemed to buck the trend cross-linguistically; _it appeared to do something that was not expected to happen based on data from across numerous languages_. The question was then how to account for it? And then what would it mean for the linguistic theory if we were to account for it? It was during this process where I discovered that I didn't truly understand a bunch of the papers I had been reading until I read it for the third time and it clicked with what I was trying to investigate. -->

There was so many ways things didn't turn out how I expected them to turn out this year. After semester 1, I had to pivot my research project topic because my original topic really wasn't big enough to fit the ten thousand word requirement. Some of the papers I read for my research project, I had to read three times before I truly grasped what they meant and how they fit together and related to my topic. And so often, I would read papers that seemed interesting but actually weren't very relevant to what I was doing. There was also an elicitation<sup>1</sup> topic that I had to widen because the language we were probing only used one word for so many concepts (very, quite, etc).

The lesson itself didn't even hit me even though it was oft repeated to us in semester 1 until I heard something similar at a book launch<sup>2</sup> I went to this year. And in fact, I couldn't get myself out of not writing or working on my creative projects (after uni finished) until a book YouTuber I started watching finished writing a book she was working on and I was reminded that if I didn't write or work on these projects, no one else would.

But did I regret this year? Interestingly not. If I could go back in time... I would obviously be more prepared for postgrad, perhaps do the early reading for one of the classes :eyes:, do a little bit of research beforehand into my interested topics, ... but strangely despite all the stress and extremely late (or early) nights, I would do it all again. I met a few interesting people this year, finally found new execs to take over the linguistic club at uni, and actually genuinely enjoyed what I discovered this year. However, I'm not sure academia is the right fit for me and so I likely won't be going further.

This year also showed me that I actually have skills. Over the course of my undergrad I felt pretty terribly that I either wasn't learning any actionable skills, was learning old information (CPUs are going to hit 5GHz soon!), or that we weren't being taught very well (figure out those steps we skipped to get to the solution in your own time). But I actually got to practice some programming and some statistics and proved to myself that I am competent. For one of my assignments, I retested the statistical analysis presented in a paper and also tested some of their assumptions about the data, writing the statistical tests as Python scripts that I then ran on the same data. Guess my degree _was_ worth it. I was and am pretty happy with myself.

But enough about the slog that is uni, what about outside of uni?

I started reading again over the last few years but this year I finally found a particular genre that interests me. Early on in the year, I read _Before the Coffee Gets Cold_, a short Japanese collection of stories revolving around a café that can presumably take you back in time, and though I'm not the type for stories investigating relationship and familial dynamics, it was quite a moving set of stories. Later on in the year, I read _Ficciones_ by Jorge Luis Borges, a collection of strange and interesting stories with magical realistic and metaphysical themes. That was the book that truly sparked my interest. On a Spanish kick, I decided to read _The Dangers of Smoking in Bed_, a collection of "scary" stories by Mariana Enriquez that I would classify more as existential or implication in its horror rather than truly a scare. I also read a few of Claire Keegan's books: _Small Things Like These_ and _Foster_, and found them moving though I did not like their endings (sudden, and open). Conclusion: I think I like translated fiction (though Claire Keegan isn't translated).

You know how they say not to take drugs cause they get you hooked?

Well, I've recently fallen back into the mechanical keyboard hobby. Originally, I got into the hobby because it was COVID and I was bored in lockdown and I'm not good with discretionary capital. But this time, I heard about the launch of a more mass producible version of an "endgame" keyboard and I got really interested because it's much more affordable<sup>3</sup>. I opened a keycap set that I bought three years ago and refused to open because ABS = rubbish (even though it cost me $$$) but OMG these keycaps are so good. Don't worry I haven't started spending... yet. But I'll tell you more at a later date.

<!-- \[Addendum: So I planned to post this before we left for Aussie or just before the year ended but that obviously didn't happen. On reflection, the flow of this post isn't the best (hence this insert) but I am happy with the current state (aka, cbf editing) and I can't procrastinate posting it anymore :eyes:.\] -->

I feel like there could be more to say in this post but I can't think of anything off the top of my head so for now as always I'll just say: thank you for reading.

~~and~~ Merry Holidays (and Happy New Year) !
