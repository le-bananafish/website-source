# Māori Language Week

It's Māori language week and since people are arguing over the language and it's in the news again, I thought I'd weigh in on the debate if you can even call it that.

First, here's a list of reasons people give not to learn Māori:

- It's a ~~dead~~ dying language
- It's a ~~dead~~ dying culture
- (_Some idea of superiority_)
- You get the idea

Secondly, I would like to say I'm a linguist, or to be more exact, I'm studying linguistics. I'm only in Stage 1 but I've dabbled in the area before through conlanging (a post for another time).

One of the most common opinions against the Māori language is that "_it is a dying language_" and relatedly that their culture isn't important, or that our culture doesn't have any interactions with it (i.e. we don't experience Māori culture at all in NZ).

Whether Te Reo Māori is dying or not, I can't say. Apparently, there is a resurgence in the NZ diaspora and the youth seem to be happy to learn it. Some of these criticisms are in response to suggestions that we make Te Reo Māori compulsory for years 1 to 10. The second component, that Māori culture is either dead or irrelevant to New Zealanders is a __blatant lie__.

Let me list some words that are apparently not Māori:

- Aotearoa (it's the name of our country for f* sake)
- Rotorua
- Taupo
- Ruapeha (a famous Mt. and ski-field)
- Tangariro (National Park)
- Piha
- Waitangi
- Karangahape (Rd.) (a.k.a K Rd)
- Manukau
- Remuera (everyone knows this place)
- Rangitoto
- Waiheke (loved by tourists)
- Cape Reinga (the top of NZ)
- Kaitaia
- Waitomo (the glow-worm cave)

Yea nah. These words are integral place names, integral because otherwise WTF would we call them. I know Karangahape Road is often shortened to K Rd but excluding that, all the other words are __integral__ to our lives. Interesting how affluent NZ European people live in a suburb with a Māori name, eh? And then let's look at another list of words that we love:

- (do the) mahi
- Kiwi
- Kakapo
- Weta
- Poi
- Kai
- Whare
- Taringa whakarongo (beloved by teachers)
- Ka pai
- and I honestly could spend three hours typing more (__I've found more__)
- aroha
- hangi
- haka
- hui
- makō
- mana
- marae
- moa
- tuatara
- waiata
- waka
- whānau (ADD HYP first a)
- kauri (the most famous tree in NZ: ___TANE MAHUTA___)

Now you're looking at me and saying, so what? These are just words, who cares? And then you forget how even though they're just words, the way that culture seeps through into other cultures is through experiencing the culture but also through words.

_[INSERT MEME ABOUT "WHAT'S SPANISH FOR TACO?"]_

Let's tackle the arguments that Māori is useless because well, 1) We're a country at the bottom of the world, 2) NZ is the only place where people speak Māori, although Cook Islands is the most closely related and 3) Choose one from the list: _["English", "Chinese", "Spanish", "French", "German", "Japanese"]_ is an "_international_" language and has more speakers and is more globally important.

Well, let me tell you something. Yes, we are the only country that has Māori but guess what? That makes us unique. NZ is a multicultural country, even if some say we are not or that we are only bi-cultural. Saying we shouldn't learn Māori because only Māori speak it is like saying Finnish people shouldn't learn Finnish at all and only learn something from that list (This is a response to "_Finnish people learn English because otherwise who wants to learn their language._").

I hope you get the point. Almost every single language is the world is unique to a specific group. Taking English, even though it is a _de facto lingua franca_, there are numerous unique dialects e.g. UK English (and its numerous dialects), US English (also numerous dialects), South African English, Singaporean/Malaysian English, Australian English and our very own, much beloved and head-turning NZ English. Each of these is specific to their people.

Back to Māori making us unique. NZ is known globally because of things like Manukau honey, Pounama, the haka that the All Blacks perform before every game among the many things Westerners make us known for.

By all means take Māori lessons in primary as a joke (not endorsing racism) _just like you take language lessons in general_ but when it comes to learning the language and its importance, stop __lying__ to yourself.
