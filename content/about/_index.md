Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this ___me___ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I have finished and will soon graduate with a BSc in Computer Science and a BA in Linguistics, done as a conjoint degree, from the University of Auckland. I am currently studying a postgraduate honours degree in Linguistics. 

I describe myself as a pessimist idealist &mdash; I hope for a bright future for humanity but I am sceptical about how we're tracking to get there. Nonetheless, I remain interested in technological advancements, social impact and creative endeavours.

For a background on my technical knowledge, I have some experience in the following programming languages: C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, C#, and Web basics (HTML, CSS, JS). I also have some knowledge of the static site generators Jekyll and Hugo. Hugo is currently used to build this site.

I built this site in part as something to put on the CV but it is mainly used as a platform for me to express things openly, something that I don't do very often. As a forewarning, posts may be stream of consciousness or may read as incoherent ideas stitched together.

<!-- Thank you and hopefully I :eye: you around my site. -->
