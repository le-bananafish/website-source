Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this _<b>me</b>_ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I am currently studying a conjoint degree in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Auckland.

I write stories, aspire to start a technology company and occasionally take decent photographs. I am currently working on my worldbuilding project _New Horizons_, announcement [here](https://le-bananafish.github.io/posts/new-horizons/)", whilst my plans for a company are on hold.

I have experience with various programming languages such as: C++ through informatics, Rust as a hobby and Python as part of university courses. I have dabbled with static site generators such as Jekyll and Hugo, the latter with which this site was built; and other languages such as Haskell which intrigued but confused me.

And finally, because I am normally reserved with my words and tend to keep opinions and considerations to myself, I've decided to be unnecessarily blunt with this blog (_not too much_) and it is very much stream-of-consciousness.

Thank you and hopefully I <!-- _see_ --> :eye: you around my site.
