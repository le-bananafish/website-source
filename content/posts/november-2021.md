## Preamble

Isn't ironic when you're busy, you yearn for free time, but when you have lots of free time, you're bored out of your mind?

No, just me?

## November Update

So, you may have noticed that my last post was in July; before that, the last post was in April. I managed to write enough to scrape by _for the first four months_.

It's been a long year and I've forgotten most things. Like when we went into lockdown. again. The gap between July and now overlapped with intersem break where I got triggered about something, likely related to uni \*ahem\* COMPSCI and... two weeks later, semester 2 started.

<!-- Sometime during Semester 2, I forgot that the last time I had posted was July (I thought it was August) and by the time I felt enough motivation to post again it was September. Uni was starting to get rough, assignments and tests were piling on (my courses all decided October was the time to shove in all the coursework) and I just didn't have the time to do anything (except suffer). -->

In September, I realised that the last time I had posted was in July and not August as I thought but by that time, October was coming up. October for me was hell; all of my courses decided it would be the best time to cram in all the assignments and tests, so all I had time to do was suffer. October passed painfully but quickly and...

<!-- Now, it's November, almost the end of the month actually, and I feel like s*** and... (I'm) bored. Hence, my preamble. -->

Now, it's almost the end of November, and I feel like s*** and I'm bored. Hence, my preamble.

So... I would say I've failed my New Years Resolution. <&#8595;>

> I promise to write at least one post per fortnight, or at the bare minimum, once a month. &mdash; January, 2021

But I'm not giving up. Hence, why I'm writing this post.

[future me]: This _is_ a __long__ one. Sit tight.

<!-- So, the next sections are going to be about me, like, _really_ about me. -->

<!-- __Oh, so this is going to be about _me_. Well, duh.__ -->

## Reflection \#1: On Creativity

I wouldn't say I'm the most expressive person. I tell everyone I meet (probably not the best way to introduce oneself) that I don't talk much. In conversations, I honestly just sit/stand and absorb the discussion, and answer in very plain but vague terms when asked about myself.

<!-- But I _could_ describe myself as creative, at least ~~internally~~introspectively. That probably made no sense. I like to think I have a very vivid imagination, at least I did when I was younger, and though the potency is no longer there, the things I think up (or dream of; this is the crux of my argument - my dreams) are quite [bizarre/unique]. -->

But I _do_ see myself as creative, at least mentally. That probably made no sense. When I was younger, I had a very strong imagination and I had horrifying but intriguing (in hindsight) dreams (well, nightmares). And though the potency is no longer there, the things I think up have some merit to them.

<!-- The problem is, as I said in the introduction, that I'm not very expressive. I can't process the things I've dreamed up and convert them into physical artefacts, i.e. pictures or text. My ideas and dreams are the most abstract of things and as a result I can't draw them (not that I can draw anyway). -->

The problem is, as I said in the introduction, that I'm not very expressive. The things I used to/often think up and dream of are too vivid and abstract for me to draw or express in words. Also, dreams are ephemeral as well.

<!-- There is a running joke (\*ahem\* between my parents) that when I was in _early_ primary, I would write sentences like "I am a boy. This is a dog," i.e. not very descriptive. And though it's not that simple, I would say that can be true. Either I give a basic description or I give you a technical breakdown of the character/object/location. There's no middle ground between them. I'm exaggerating a little. -->

There is a running joke (\*ahem\* between my parents) that when I was in _early_ primary, I would write sentences like "I am a boy. This is a dog," i.e. not very descriptive. And though it's not that simple, I would say that can be true. I tend to use very literal descriptions and when I'm in a flow, it tends to become a technical breakdown of the character/object/location.

<!-- So, the "cool ideas", my "novels" and "short stories" largely all exist in my head, sorry to disappoint you all. Short stories I have five or so written but haven't refined them yet so there's hope. But my "novels" don't ~~really~~ exist. -->

As a result, my "ideas", "novels" and "short stories" all largely exist in my head. I have written five or so short stories but haven't refined them yet. My "novels" don't ~~really~~ exist.

<!-- The other problem with me (there's a lot) is that whenever a critical event that has happened in whatever fictional world I've imagined is over, it's over for me. I've experienced it completely, fully, and with nothing else to uncover. Mind you that's in my head. I don't write down what's happened or the emotions of it, and to make a long story short, consequently when it comes to needing to write that event down, I don't feel the need to. It's done. -->

<!-- Another problem is that I "live" through the flash points and critical moments in my fictional worlds, [thinking up] the emotions of the characters that have gone through the events and how it changes them, shapes their being. Once that point of inflection is over, for me, that part of the story is over. It's complete. And since I don't write down the emotions, the detail, the aftermaths, the lingering effects of the event (a very big problem), when it comes to writing the event, I can't and I don't feel the need to. It's done. -->

Another problem is that I "live" through the important moments in my fictional worlds, the emotions of the characters that have gone through them and how it changes them, shapes their being. Once that is over, for me, that part of the story is over. It's complete. And since I don't write it down, or in useful detail, when it comes to writing out the event, I can't and I don't feel the need to. It's done.

<!-- ~~I need to start writing things down~~. -->
<!-- `NB:` There's hope! I actually started writing things down, because I realised there's different versions of those events that no longer make a consistent picture. -->

`NB:` There's hope! I actually started writing things down, because I started to encounter (when I went back to it) slightly different versions of the same event that were hard to reconcile.

<!-- So... progress. -->

But there's still a lot of pivotal moments in my fictional worlds that are lost, _like tears in the rain_.

## Reflection \#2: This site

<!-- So, if you can't parse my stream of consciousness or vague references, a previous iteration of my site existed and it was "made" using a static site generator called Jekyll. That site was a lot more empty that this one; I can't even remember how many posts there were. -->

Since I'm sure that no one's read the post about it, a previous iteration of my site was made using a static site generator called Jekyll. Long story short, I ran into a few problems, some of them my own doing, so I later switched to Hugo which I use today.

<!-- It's probably inexperience but I couldn't figure out how to make tags work with Jekyll. I think the theme I used did it one way but the standard way was another and I couldn't make the changes I wanted to. Anyways, one day I decided to update the theme (which I should do for this site as well) and the site broke. I couldn't fix it because the dependencies had changed and I was really against using some of them (\*ahem\* Ruby and Node.js?), so I gave up. The site just sat there broken for a while. -->

<!-- `Aside:` Oh also, GitHub Pages, which lets you host static websites for free and is how I host this site, only allows a certain number of whitelisted plugins (for Jekyll), but more useful plugins that the theme depended upon weren't. So, the choice was either self-host, or what I do with Hugo, self-build, then let GitHub Pages host it like a simple collection of HTML pages. But back then, I didn't know or wasn't confident enough to either of them. -->

<!-- A while later and I think I had always heard about the alternative, spoiler, the generator I use to make this site, I decided to give it a go. There are obviously some architectural differences between Jekyll and Hugo. Hugo is written in Go, whilst Jekyll is written in Ruby, and does not support plugins but is more featured intrinsically. My Hugo site worked off the hook(?) and things didn't break. (Let's be honest, that's the programmer's definition of success.) -->

<!-- Anyways, this is all just preamble. -->

<!-- `NB:` Ooooh, you can read more about my troubles (and reasons) [here](../new-site-who-this.md). -->

You can read about my troubles [here](../new-site-who-this.md). The crux of the matter is:

_I don't feel it's honest to say I built this site._

<!-- I've built very s**tty and basic sites for a uni course (would not recommend), and all I did with Hugo AND Jekyll was learn how they work, select a theme, and insert my content. That doesn't feel like "building" to me. -->

I've built very s**tty and basic sites for a uni course (would not recommend), and all I've done with Hugo AND Jekyll was learn how to set them up, select a theme, and insert my content. That doesn't feel like "building" to me.

<!-- I'm not using Hugo to its full potential. Despite their differences, themes for both generators are quite opaque to me, they're like magic glue that somehow turns into something nice to look at. But once again, the documentation feels so bare and opaque to me. But I want to learn. So, the thing you see in the footer: -->

<!-- I'm not using Hugo to its full potential. Despite their differences, themes for both generators are like magic fairy dust that somehow turns into something nice to look at. And the documentation for both tools feels so bare and basic to me. But I want to learn. -->

I'm not using Hugo to its full potential. There's a lot of power and customisation available for both generators that are nicely wrapped up by their themes. However, they feel like magic fairy dust that somehow turns everything into something nice to look at. And I find it hard to understand the documentation for both generators.

But I want to learn.

<!-- So, the thing you see in the footer: -->

You might've seen in the footer:


> Copyright 2018 Sebastian Lau<br>
> Hugo with Sam theme.

<!--    Copyright 2018 Sebastian Lau -->
<!--    Hugo with Sam theme. -->

That is something __I__ did. I overrode the default footer, which you can do by creating a copy of the specific file in the theme in the right folder in your project, and changed its contents.

<!-- `WARNING:` [Rewrite!] -->

<!-- There's other things. That blocks/examples I showed you above are ugly (maybe I'm too used to GitHub Flavoured Markdown). I want to be able to change that. The first block is a \<blockquote> and the second is a \<pre>. My issue with the blockquote is that there's too much whitespace, especially if I just want a one-liner; and my issue with the pre are the scrollbar and its width. -->

There's other things. Some parts of the theme I'm using, like the blockquotes above, don't look very nice. The blockquote specifically doesn't extend all the whole width as I like it and I feel like there's too much whitespace surrounding, especially if you only have one line (maybe I'm too used to GitHub Flavoured Markdown). As I said, I wasn't too sure where to change these things.

<!-- A change which I was going to make then forgot about was: __update the theme__! When I first trialled updating the theme, it felt like my site was moving from low quality into HD. The font was sharper and overall everything was more legible. But when I came back a while later, I couldn't really tell the difference anymore. Add to that that there were a bunch of posts I thought about writing but hadn't, and I didn't want to make any breaking changes. So, I put it off. -->

As I said in [July](../july-2021), I trialled updating the theme and it felt like my site was upgrading from low quality into HD. The whole design was sharper, especially the font. But when I came back a while later, I couldn't really tell the difference anymore. What stopped me from updating anyway was that there were a bunch of posts I thought about writing and I didn't want to make any breaking changes.

I'll have a look and see if it's needed.

Here's just a small list of things I'd like to change:

- have post titles appear in the title bar instead of just the site name
- modify the design of some elements, e.g. blockquotes, line rules
- add a automatic "return to top" button if the post is too long (I did test this out)
- make the [tags](/tags) page more informative, right now it's just a list
- make lists in general show more detail and be better structured
- auto generate a _nice_ table of contents for longer posts
- allow the user/me to change fonts (the theme hardcodes the font atm)

I'll update you on how I go with them.

## Reflection \#3: Projects

Oh jeez, where do I start?

So when people ask me what I do, I often tell them about my projects, mostly New Horizons the writing project, and say I "write stories". What a lie. I spend more time imbibing random facts tangential to my projects, i.e. binging Wikipedia. But anyways, I wanted to talk about my projects, _transparently_.

Whenever people ask why I decided to study computer science, I tell them it's because I wanted to write an operating system. The long version of the story is long so I won't elaborate here. I've told some people that one of my projects is an operating system; that's both true and __not true__ at the same time.

<!-- I'm __not__ currently writing an operating system. I don't have the technical knowledge of how to and I don't have the full picture of what I think it should be comprised of or how it should work. I _am_ working out those details though. But don't expect to see anything remotely like Windows or macOS for even the next decade. There is no code. This is a long term pipe dream. -->

I'm __not__ writing an operating system. I haven't exactly decided what I'm trying to do and I don't have the confidence that my programming skills are up to the task. I __did__, however, recently resume planning it out. But don't expect to see anything remotely like Windows or macOS for even the next decade. This is a long term pipe dream.

<!-- `DEPR:` It's been a while since I worked on New Horizons. Essentially whenever its exam time, I would start thinking about it and then be too lazy to bother during the holidays. Then, I started "imbibing random facts tangential to my projects" which especially during the COVID lockdown last year took me down the rabbit hole into other existing IPs, such as Warhammer, Borderlands, and Magic the Gathering. As my interest was focused on these things, they then started to leak into and influence New Horizons (and other projects) turning it (them) into an amalgamated mass of disparate ideas. -->

<!-- The problem of how to resolve this, what to keep and what to excise, really weighed mentally on me and so I put the project on the backburner. Also, the state of the repository, i.e. how I've stored my project, was a bit of a mess for a long while and I only recently resumed organising the information. -->

<!-- `DEPR:` I also started a new project between December of last year and the beginning of this year. It's had many drastic changes in scope and focus, and I put parts of it on the backburner as well. It was, \*cringe\*, inspired by a singular Magic the Gathering card, which I then elaborated into a whole narrative. I started writing the first two stories but it also got hit with inconsistency issues and I got overwhelmed with uni. So, my main focus for it is currently on the backburner too. (Do you see a trend?) -->

It's also been a while since I worked on any project, such as <u>_New Horizons_</u> or <u>_Indigo_</u>. My go to excuse for this is uni, especially in October when all I did was survive.

Right here in this post, I originally wrote three giant paragraphs explaining how I basically absorb themes and ideas from whatever game, movie, or tv series that I'm interested in at the time and how this leaks into and jumbles up my projects. Since my memory is shot, I didn't realise I already touched on that in [Indecision and Imitation](../indecision-and-imitation.md).

I really don't know how to turn that off. Indigo was originally about politics and religion set in a Middle Ages setting and the fantastical magical elements weren't important to the story. But under the influence of Magic the Gathering with its multiverse and high-powered mages, magic and supernatural creatures seem to want to leak into Indigo.

And as a consequence, my neat little narrative is being pulled left and right by strong forces to expand. The world threatens to get bigger.

<!-- If you can't tell, this reflection is a _confession_. I'm a liar. I don't write. My projects don't progress. It's a problem that I haven't figured out how to solve yet. -->

This reflection ~~is~~___was___ a confession: _I'm a liar. I don't write. My projects don't progress. It's a problem that I haven't figured out how to solve yet._

Now it's not. Anyways...

<!-- In the interest of wow, full transparency!, I will be deprecating (\*ahem\* deleting) the following article: -->
In the interest of wow, full transparency!, I will be modifying the following articles:

- "New Horizons" deleted [Thurs Dec 12, 2019]
- "Maintenance 2021" renamed to "April 2021" <sup>(*)</sup>

"New Horizons" is really vague because I don't want to reveal important plot points of the novel(s) I haven't written, and also because the project itself is quite complicated and hard to explain. Since the post doesn't feel right, I'm getting rid of it. Yay revisionism!

I'm renaming "Maintenance" to "April" to fall in line with the other 'update' type posts I've written. <sup>(*)</sup>: <sup>You'll still be able to access it with the existing link.</sup>

<!-- As the cherry on top, here's a list of the "projects" I came up with or worked on this year (or in 2020, can't remember) and how they're going. -->

Just for kicks, here's a list of the projects I came up with or worked on this year (or in 2020, can't remember) and how they're going.

Projects

- New Horizons [backburner; should be writing]
- Redacted (_operating system_) [re-invigorated; design phase]
- Indigo [backburner; should be writing]
- Yellow Indium (_card game_) [kinda dead]
- new Quirinus/"The Department" [dead; some ideas may stay]
- old Quirinus (_video game_) [dead; some ideas will stay]

<sup>`NB:`</sup> Useless information but new Quirinus/"The Department" and old Quirinus exist in the New Horizons universe.

## Closing Thoughts

Promises. Promises. I've made a few of them in this post and since I've broken the resolution, who knows if I'm going to keep them. But I'll try. Sorry Master Yoda, for me, there __is__ try, not just do.

One last thing, I've been watching Cowboy Bebop, both the original anime and the new live-action Netflix show. I've been striping them (one 'p'), watching a few episodes of each at a time, and whilst its still early days, the new one is a bit too comedic. The anime has humour but I would say it's more melancholic and pensive. So... I might write a review on them, we'll see. (Also, Arcane is awesome!)

Anyways, thanks for reading folks. I know it was a long one. Come back soon!
