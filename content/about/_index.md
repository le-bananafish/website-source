Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this _<b>me</b>_ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I am currently studying Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Auckland.

I have experience with C++, Rust (_incumbent_) and Python (_incumbent_) as well as some experience with Jekyll and Hugo.

I am hoping to be a delusional person and start a company which provides some service I have not yet conceived of.

Oh, I'm going to be unnecessarily blunt because I'm normally very not blunt.

Thank you, and hopefully I _see_ :eye: you around my site.
