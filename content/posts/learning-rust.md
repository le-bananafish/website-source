# Fighting the borrow checker

Anyone who has tried learning the Rust programming language will be familiar with the phrase "_fighting the borrow checker_". It is the formative event in the Rust programmer's life. Trying to figure out why the compiler won't let you compile a piece of code. Those who use interpreted languages like Python and Ruby will not understand the pain of your code having to first succesfully compile before being able to run it. Whilst I say pain here, to the compiled language programmer, it is a feeling of satisfaction because compilation guarantees that your code will definitely run (barring runtime errors and software vulnerabilities). In Rust's case, fighting the borrow checker is also a guarantee that it won't crash or be subject to software vulnerabilites (as long as you don't do anything `unsafe`).

Fighting the borrow checker, no matter how painful and regardless of the formative aspect of this process, is actually a fun though frustrating part of the development process and the satisfaction knowing that your code will work as written is second to none.

Thanks for reading and I hope you have a good day.

P.S. I thought this would be longer and it might be in the near future but at the momemnt, this is it.
