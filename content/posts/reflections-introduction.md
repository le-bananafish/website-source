# reflektioner <sup>[(sv)][1]</sup>

I'm going to make a bold and untenable claim &mdash; I'm starting a series of reflections on various topics, ranging from stuff in my personal life to contemplation on the state of my various projects.

There'll be no set release schedule; I think by now we all know I can't stick to one. I'm making this series because I've been doing it a lot recently <sup>(in my head)</sup> : I've finished uni <sup>(I finally got a (casual) job)</sup> and I have no clue what I'm going to do in life.

The first one will be on my journey with laptops or computers in general. That's because I've bought <sup>(ordered)</sup> a new laptop &mdash; the new M2 MacBook Air to be specific &mdash; and I ruminated for a long time whether that was a smart choice.

I said I was going to make untenable claim(s) so here's one more &mdash; I'll even dedicate a series to the state and progress of my projects. My focus is on _New Horizons_ and _Harmony_ which exist in a shared canon. New Horions is a bloated and fragmented project, and I'm having trouble fitting Harmony into its canon. In future, I might starting talking about other projects, like _Indigo_.

That's it. That's all I have to say for now &mdash; thanks for reading.
