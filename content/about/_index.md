Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this ___me___ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I am in the final stages of a conjoint in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Auckland, intending to continue with a BA(Hons) in Linguistics. 

I would consider myself to be somewhat of a dreamer but such a description is problematic. Though a dreamer is often a visionary, they can also be someone who is unwilling to see reality. I'm not certain which one I am. What inspired me all those years ago to take computer science and what inspires me now are very different things. *What hasn't changed, however, is an interest in innovation and creativity*.

<!-- My <sup>\*NEW\*</sup> tagline: -->

> A perennial dreamer, I create worlds, write stories and stockpile ideas.

I'm not a writer, an entrepreneur, or an artist but I would like to be all of these things. I'm not a politician, activist or culture expert but I understand that everything we do, even something local, has a place and impact on the global sphere. These are important ideas that underpin my endeavours.

I have a few personal projects which I claim to always be working on. Most of which are of a more creative and multimedia nature than of a programming nature. You can find more information about them [here](../tags/projects).

For a background on my technical knowledge, I have learnt programming in the following languages to varying degrees of competence: C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, C#, and Web basics (HTML, CSS, JS).

I also have basic knowledge on a few static site generators, such as Jekyll and Hugo, both of which have been used to build this site. Its current iteration is running on Hugo.

And finally, if you're wondering why I made this site, part of the reason is that I read it was a good demonstration of skill to list on your CV, and the other part is that this site serves as a platform for me to express my ideas openly, something which I don't often do. As a result, some posts may be stream of consciousness or may read as incoherent ideas stitched together.

All in all, you'll learn things you never knew about me.

<!-- Brainstorming:

- I have always wanted to start up a company "to change the world".
- I have always had vivid dreams and ideas that I had the burning desire to realise, but never the means to
- I care about the world, about social issues, about peace and political stability
- [Rewrite] I take naps, read Wikipedia articles, and occasionally write stories.
- I am always working on secret projects, some of which are related to programming. Most are about exploring my ideas.
- Lots of my concepts, ideas and plans are lost to the clearing of my short term memory because I refused to write them down out of fear of theft and out of seeking perfection even with incomplete ideas.
- My programming experience includes C, C++, C#, Rust, Python, Java, and web basics (HTML, CSS, JS). Greatest experience is with C++ (high school club) and Python (first stage uni courses). My preferred programming paradigm is a mix of OOP and functional.
- I have experience with two static website generators: Jekyll with which I created an earlier version of this site, and Hugo with which this version of this site is created. Though my experience is very basic, I am interested in learning more about Hugo, especially as I intend to develop this site further. -->

<!-- I have quite a few personal projects that I'm working on at various times. They cover various areas such as operating systems, worldbuilding, card games, and constructed languages. None of them are complete, you can see posts on any of them [here](/tags/projects). -->

<!-- I am working on my worldbuilding project titled _New Horizons_. New Horizons is about the stories of individuals, their struggles and tribulations. It aims to capture the stories of life rather than stories as presented in television and film. See the [announcement](/posts/new-horizons). -->

<!-- My tentatively titled company _The Dreamers Club_ is currently on-hold. This is because I both lack the expertise required for many of my aspirations and am uncertain about how to launch the company. See its [mission](#). -->

<!-- To any interested party, I have experience with a few programming languages acquired through various activities. C++ was my first language and acquired through a high school club and participation in informatics. Although Rust has been a long-time interest, it has often been neglected in lieu of C, Python and Java which I am required to use for university courses. -->

<!-- I should mention Jekyll and Hugo, two static site frameworks which I have used for my personal website. Jekyll was used for a previous version of this site whereas Hugo is currently powering this website. -->

<!-- The purpose of this site is to share things that I consider personal and would normally not share, such as my stories, ideas, thoughts and hobbies as well as completely random things. -->

<!-- As I am normally reserved with my words, I will be more open and direct with the content on this site, and it will often be in a stream of consciousness. However, you may notice when my itchy editing finger has meddled with the content. -->

<!-- Thank you and hopefully I :eye: you around my site. -->
