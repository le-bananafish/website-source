Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this _<b>me</b>_ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I am currently studying a conjoint degree in Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Auckland.

I have experience with C++ through informatics, learn Rust as a hobby and Python as part of my university degree. I have dabbled with numerous things; from the Haskell language to static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo, the latter with which this site was built.

I have aspirations to start a company with a mission that I believe has great potential but I am not averse to working at ordinary companies and perhaps, I will need to in my journey. See more about The Dreamers' Club [here](https://thedreamersclub.github.io).

And finally, because I am normally reserved with my words and tend to keep opinions and considerations to myself, I've decided to be unnecessarily blunt with this blog (_not too much_) and it is very much stream-of-consciousness.

Thank you and hopefully I <!-- _see_ --> :eye: you around my site.
