## Project Indigo

Ever since around January 2021, I've been working on a worldbuilding project that I've given the codename __Project Indigo__. It started off as a subproject of another larger project but I've put that one on the backburner. You can think of Indigo as a fictional world like a D&D setting or a Magic plane but it's not for role-playing.

The setting is a roughly Middle Ages society where modern medicine is a nascent field and most people still rely on traditional healing. As the world is pre-industrial, transport and trade is conducted via water and land, and land travel often takes a long time.

<!-- However, I may add steam technology<sup>(*1)</sup>. -->

The main narrative is set against a recent war, known as the War of Attrition, which lasted 20 years. The war was fought over religion but the focus is largely on its political aspects. The War of Attrition destroyed an entire country (_Land_ in the fictional language Frey), resulted in the annexation and suppression of another and the rise of a divine theocracy in another (this is really vague, I know).

<!-- The main narrative is set against a recent past war, known as the War of Attrition, which lasted 20 years. The war destroyed an entire country/kingdom (_Land_ in the native language Frey), resulted in the annexation of another<sup>(*2)</sup> and the rise of a divine theocracy in another. -->

There are two major faiths in the world of Indigo : the _Faith of the Raven Tree_ and the _Faith of the First Altar_. Though their doctrine is not relevant to the story, how the actions of the characters are guided by the faiths is.

Our main character lives in the country ruled by a divine theocracy, having been sold by her parents during the course of the war because they could no longer raise her. She works in the hospitals as a healer. Long frustrated with the corruption and hypocrisy within the theocracy, she pens an anonymous letter, signed only with "E", to express her dissent. The letter reaches the people and spreads like wildfire, stoking their dissatisfaction &mdash; a revolt is at hand.

This is where the story begins.

<!-- At the present moment, I have started the first two stories though they are nowhere near complete. -->

`NB:` This is just a teaser but I have started the first two _stories_. Though they are both incomplete, I have outlines.

## Frey

_As if I'm not drowning with uni assignments_, I decided to make a conlang for Indigo, specifically for the common language spoken in the main countries. The idea for it came from trying to figure the origins of the peoples of my world, and I was encouraged by the fact I took a Middle English course last semester.

The language, called __Frey__, is a pseudo-Germanic language with a Latinate superstrate. _What does this mean in general terms?_ The language is similar to English; a lot of its words and forms are from English, but it also takes inspiration from the Proto-Germanic roots that underlie English's words and from the Proto-Indo-European roots that underlie those.

For example, English has the adjective *rich* and the Proto-Germanic root form is something like *rīkijaz, where the \<ch> /t͡ʃ/ sound was originally a /k/. By the sound processes of my constructed language Frey, Proto-Frey /k/ became /x/, and so Frey has the adjective also spelled *rich* but pronounced /rix/.

However, it also has a Latinate influence, originating from Classical and Vulgar Latin, and French. This influence appears through the use of two sets of pronouns and articles; one derived from French/Latin, the other native to English/Germanic. The formal pronouns were originally reserved for colonists as a marker of deference, but are now generally used for royalty, nobility and the high ranks of the clergy.

Notes
</p>
<ul>

<li>(*<sup>1</sup>) Though originally reserved for the colonists, jei (j') are now commonly used by everyone.

<li>(*<sup>2</sup>) Whilst the polite first person plural exists, it is rarely used in the nominative (as the subject). It is largely only used in legal and formal contexts.

I don't know what I'm going to do with this conlang; it is partly just for fun. It may appear when my characters are reading (since I'm writing in English). Maybe one day, if I publish these stories and someone decides to adapt them into film or television, the characters can all speak in Frey instead. One can dream, _right_?

[\...]

I'll end this here and claim that you'll get snippets of the first story next time. Regardless, thanks for reading!
