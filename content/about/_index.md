Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this ___me___ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I am currently studying a postgraduate BA(Hons) degree in Linguistics, and have a BSc in Computer Science and a BA in Linguistics from the University of Auckland.

<!-- I describe myself as a pessimist idealist &mdash; I hope for a bright future for humanity but I am sceptical about how we're tracking to get there. Nonetheless, I remain interested in technological advancements, social impact and creative endeavours. -->

I built this site in part as something to put on the CV and in part as a platform for me to express my thoughts, something I rarely do so openly. As a forewarning, this means that posts may be stream of consciousness or may read as incoherent thoughts stitched together.

<!-- For a background on my technical knowledge, I have some experience in the following programming languages: C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, C#, and Web basics (HTML, CSS, JS). I also have some knowledge of the static site generators Jekyll and Hugo. Hugo is currently used to build this site. -->
