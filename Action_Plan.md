# Action Plan

things to fix / add / improve

- update theme version?
- have post titles appear in the title bar instead of just the site name
- modify the design of some elements, e.g. blockquotes, line rules
- add a automatic “return to top” button if the post is too long (I did test this out)
- make the tags page more informative, right now it’s just a list
- make lists in general show more detail and be better structured
- auto generate a nice table of contents for longer posts
- allow the user/me to change fonts (the theme hardcodes the font atm)
- remove all obsolete files e.g. tags that no longer exist

Thanks for coming to my TED talk.
