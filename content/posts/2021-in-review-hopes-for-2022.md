## Part 1: Year of Stanisław Lem (2021) in Review

<u>__Year of Stanisław Lem__</u>

_The year of 2021 is declared the Year of Stanisław Lem in Poland, according to the November 27, 2020 resolution of Sejm (the lower house of the parliament of Poland). [...] 2021 is the year of the 100th Stanisław Lem anniversary._  
\- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_Lem)

I only found that out a couple of weeks ago.

How fitting that in 2021, I decided to finally read the novel he is most known for, _Solaris_. I managed to finish the novel with 24 minutes to spare.

In all honestly, I'm only exaggerating the time crunch of reading the novel. I was always going to read it but specifically prioritised reading Solaris _in 2021_ when I found out that it was the Year of Stanisław Lem. So, I effectively gave myself a deadline to read the novel by.

<!-- The novel is about a group of scientists aboard a research station as they try to understand and communicate with an extraterrestrial intelligence which takes the form of a vast ocean on the eponymous planet. -->

<!-- The novel follows a group of scientists aboard a research station on the eponymous planet as they attempt to make contact with extraterrestrial life. The entire planet is comprised of a vast ocean of gel that is revealed to be a singular entity, which scientists believe to be a living and sentient being. -->

<!-- It is certainly a novel with an interesting premise; the idea of a gigantic living ocean is and was quite novel, and the manner in which the crew interact with it is also an interesting premise. -->

<!-- However, and perhaps because I haven't read in a few years, I found parts of it somewhat incomprehensible. The novel describes the ocean's intricacies using strings of scientific jargon stringed together, criticising how sometimes the scientific community expends immense effort on creating lexicons for a topic instead of studying the actual topic. -->

Whilst the premise of the novel and the questions it posed on whether we can truly make contact with extraterrestrial life were interesting, I found parts of it incredibly difficult to even understand.

<!-- The way the book describes the ocean's phenomena, or rather the way that the scientists describe them, was incredibly difficult to parse, not because of made up words<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> or obtuse syntax but because of the way that vaguely scientific terms were stringed together to express scientific-sounding concepts that actually have no real meaning. (Jeez, that was long...) -->

The way that the book describes the phenomena exhibited by the ocean, or rather that the scientists describe them, is essentially technobabble, using scientific and technical terms but stringing them together to create the sense that they have meaning that they actually don't.

It may have just been the era the novel was written in, but I saw it as also a critique of the use of excessive jargon. The main character, through whom we experience the novel, comments on the scientific discipline which studies the planet, known as Solaristics, chronicling the various schools of thought and the corresponding jargon which rose up to explain the phenomena (and how they are all effectively meaningless).

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- <sup id="f1">[1](#a1): Lem was known for neologisms which made his works quite difficult to translate from Polish.</sup> -->

<!-- <u>:sparkles::sparkles: __Cowboy Bebop: Anime VS Live Action__ :sparkles::sparkles:</u> -->

<!-- I promised (not really) y'all a review of Cowboy Bebop. Well, I can't really be bothered watching it or any Netflix (of my own volition) at the moment so I'll just give you the general gist of things. -->

<!-- Initially sceptical, I can see what makes the original Cowboy Bebop so beloved and so ... -->

<!-- `TBC` -->

<u>__Accountability: NY's Resolution in Review__</u>

Hmmm... How did I do with my NY's Resolution?

<!-- Let's not beat around the bush, my performance regarding my NY's Resolution is only as acceptable as it is due to the fact that I wrote 3 posts in January. Overall, that resulted in a streak of 6 posts, one for each of the following three months. -->

Let's not beat around the bush, I __failed__ my NY's Resolution. I had a streak of 6 posts, three of which were written in a very short span in January, with the remaining posts being essentially one per month for the following three months.

I even amended my resolution in one of the later posts to give myself what is essentially a fallback. In view of that, let's calculate the stats based on the original resolution and based on the fallback.

<!-- Since I amended the resolution to give myself what is essentially a fallback, let's take a look at the stats from both perspectives. -->

<!-- [THOUGHT] say it like it is, stats (streak: 4, completions: ??, expected: 12, completion rate: ??/12=??%), blah blah blah -->

<!-- Well, now we see how stats can skew results. [meant to be per month, saved by the large number of posts at the beginning of the year] __OR__ -->

<!-- [manipulate stats so that the data supports my point/conclusion, i.e. expected=26]/[counterargument: the default condition was fortnight; monthly was the fallback] -->

Taking the default case (once per fortnight, i.e. Expected=26),

Stat | Value
-------|-----------
Streak | __6__
Completions | __9__
Expected | *__26__
Completion Rate | *9/26=__34.62%__

<br>
Taking the fallback case (once per month, i.e. Expected=12),

Stat | Value
-------|-----------
Streak | __6__
Completions | __9__
Expected | __12__
Completion Rate | 9/12=__75%__

<br>

Basic stats but isn't it great how the fallback case has skewed the statistics, making it look as if I haven't done all that bad? In terms of performance, nine posts is no slouch but the fallback case makes it look like I might've kept to schedule more than I did.

I wrote only 9 posts in the year though based on some of the ideas I had, I might've written around 12-13.

On reflection, I probably should've (pre-)pre-planned my posts and written them in advance of when I intended to post them. If I'm being even more "work smart", I should've set a schedule to measure my progress against.

<!-- [IDEA] Maybe I should've prepared, written them in advance, set a schedule, etc, like making YouTube videos/Twitch streaming... -->

I know all of this, about how to have a "social media" career from watching a bunch of videos (from Alpha Gaming) about how to go about streaming.

## Part 2: Hopes for 2020v2

<u>__A Little Thing Called Hope__</u>

`AMENDED:` See below "January in Review"

<!-- What hopes do I have for 2022? -->

<!-- <sup>For f***'s sake Ο (omicron)...</sup> -->

<!-- Well... I hope that Summer Lab goes ahead and that I learn some _actually useful_ entrepreneurial skills, so that I can apply for the Distinguished Graduate Award (a shocker, I'm a distinguished student !?!) using that and my being on the Linguistics and Languages Society committee (*ahem* president, ...again). -->

<!-- I hope that we get some time on campus, I don't know how sane or how productive I'll be staring at the four walls of my bedroom for another year. -->

<!-- I hope that I have friends. -->

<!-- I hope that I figure out what exactly I want to do with my life. Current options include ~~homeless~~ writer, java monkey, linguistics research, game development, ~~pretend to know~~ system development, eternal part-time worker. (I _really_ need experience.) -->

<!-- I don't know.., I don't really have hope, just the determination to actually do something I can be happy with. -->

<u>__2022 Resolutions__</u>

<!-- Well, first off I intend to continue the NY's Resolution I set in [2021](posts/a-new-year-2021/) (wow, persistence!) with small tweaks, namely changing the constraints and rewording it: -->

Well, first off I intend to continue the NY's Resolution I set in [2021](posts/a-new-year-2021/) (wow, persistence!) with a few tweaks:


<!-- > I resolve to write at least one post ~~per fortnight, or at the bare minium, once~~ a month ++<u>with a minimum target word count of 600.</u>++ -->

<!-- > I resolve to write at least one post a month with a minimum target word count of 600. -->
<!-- > I resolve to write two posts a month, one at least 600 words and another shorter post. -->
> I resolve to write at least one post a month with a target word count of 1000 words. However, I resolve to write more varied posts; some longer and some shorter, and occasionally share a story.


<!-- Secondly, I shall resolve to write this year (with some loopholes/exceptions so that it's not too overwhelming :grin:) -->

Secondly, let's make sure that I make _some_ progress on the writing "projects" I tell people about.

<!-- > I resolve to write one work per quarter ~~,actually write, this year~~ - finish the first draft of some stories, resume working on the "novel", resolve some of the plot holes and continuity errors in my notes. In the interest of fairness, I will count academic essays as long as they are 1000 words or more. -->

> I resolve to write at least one work per quarter (story drafts, novel chapters, fix continuity issues). I will count academic essays as long as they are at least 1000 words.

<!-- And tertially, I'm going to fix/sustain/create some interpersonal relationships, i.e. make some new friends. -->

<!-- > I resolve to have healthy interpersonal relationships [TBC] -->

<!-- `NB:` Ew, this sounds so cringe like I have no friends :eyes: -->

Thirdly because things come in threes:

> I resolve not to use COVID and the resultant lockdowns or working from home situations as crutches or excuses to not do certain things that would benefit me.

This one's a little vague but the gist of it is to stop using COVID as an excuse.

<!-- ---- -->

<!-- <u>__Roadmap__</u> -->

<!-- <sup>because promising things that I can't or don't deliver is great...</sup> -->

<!-- Maybe... a Cowboy Bebop review? -->

<!-- Not a post thing but hopefully I resolve some of the plot holes in New Horizons as well as decide on which versions of events are actually canonical. Not just for New Horizons really, for each project: Indigo, Harmony (`NEW`), etc... -->

<u>__January in Review__</u>

Having lived through most of January by the time you'll be able to read this post, I have to say that Year 3 of COVID does not have me optimistic about the rest of this year. Nonetheless, it's going to be interesting. We're moving into... well at the time of writing, we're 32 minutes into living under Red again. At least, it is pretty certain that we'll be going back to uni in-person for the most part.

I haven't done half the stuff I told myself I was going to do at the beginning of December but to be honest I wasn't expecting to.

Wanting to "rest", I restarted playing Destiny 2 sometime in December and well... it's been an arduous but fun grind since. As Paul Tassi [put it](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/12/24/the-case-for-2021-being-destiny-2s-best-year-to-date/?sh=3af819d046b2), 2021 might've been "the best year of Destiny 2 we've seen so far".

Bungie got rid of sunsetting (_hard-earned gear? well, wait a few seasons, you won't be able to use it anymore_), the reason I stopped playing; finally added transmogrification (reskin your armor so you don't end up looking like a random mess); honestly, I don't know what else they've done, I hadn't been playing but the game feels a lot better than where I left off.

So... my sister started watching Money Heist and since we have Vodafone TV (EOL in September? :cry:), we've been watching it on our tv.

<!-- In response to player feedback (:laughing:), Bungie rolled-back a bunch of the changes they made to the game (that made me stop playing), including __sunsetting__, aka making you constantly regrind for new gear because it'll become worthless in a few seasons, . -->
