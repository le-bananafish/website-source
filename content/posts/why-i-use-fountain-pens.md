# The rationale behind the use of antiquated writing instruments

In an age of instantaneous interconnected digitial communication and storage, one might wonder why another has a desire to use antiquated communication methods such as the pen and paper, especially a _very antiquated breed of pen_ known only in the fringes of society and cautiously mentioned in everyday society as the fountain pen. If one looks at those proclaiming the dangers of technology and the benefits of digital detox, one will find a possible answer to the question at hand. If one looks at those who proclaim that old technologies are the best and conservatively strive to use only old methods, one will find another possible answer to the question at hand.

However, _none_ of these are my answer.

My answer is that I simply hate ballpoint pens. All ballpoints are not equal and neither are all fountain pens, some will like one pen and others will despise it. These are both universal tenets. However, my dislike of ballpoints stem from two obstacles I constantly encountered in my own life. __One, ballpoints are hard to start__. Almost contradictingly ballpoints, especially ubiquitous Bic ballpoints, are marketed as "Write the First Time, Every Time!"

Interestingly, all of the criticisms levelled against fountain pens and which brought the ballpoint to life, I personally ascribe to my experience using ballpoints. Fountain pens were then unreliable, leaky, and had flow problems. A key problem is also that fountain pens are incapable of writing on materials like wood and stone. However, I find in my experience that ballpoint pens have flow problems, I hate having to press hard to start their flow and having to maintain the pressure to write consistently. Writing with a fountain pen, I find is a different affair: to write, you must simply maintain contact with your writing surface and as long as there as no quality control issues with the nib (writing tip) or feed (ink feeder), your experience will be smooth.

The second criticism I have against ballpoints is actually probably better as a criticism against most pens in New Zealand. Following European conventions, New Zealand pens are almost consistently denoted as medium point which I despise and the fine point, which I enjoy is much more limited. Buying fountain pens or any pens in New Zealand is painful as all fountain pens bought from standard retailers are almost always medium points and most general pens are also medium point. Interestingly, we seem to discourage fine points because the ubiquitous Bic Clic pens in New Zealand seem to always cost more in fine points than in medium points.

Anyways, thanks for reading!

P.S. I do not hate rollerballs, gel pens and others. They are all fine.
