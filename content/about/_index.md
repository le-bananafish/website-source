Hi, It's me. Who the hell is this _<b>me</b>_ person being referred to?

My name is Sebastian Lau.

I am currently studying Computer Science and Linguistics at the University of Auckland.

I have some experience with C++, Rust and Python (curriculum) and have dabbled with languages like Haskell to static site generators like Jekyll and Hugo, the latter with which this site was built.

I have aspirations to start up a company with a scope that I have not yet determined but which I believe has great potential.

And finally, because I am normally more reserved and tend to keep opinions and considerations to myself, I've decided to be unncessarily blunt with this blog but not too much.

Thank you and hopefully I _see_ :eye: you around my site.
